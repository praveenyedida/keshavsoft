# Bootstrap Remix Project

##  Overview
This project was built using Bootstrap 5 by remixing components such as navbars, hero sections, cards, and forms into a clean multi-page responsive website.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Bootstrap 5
- Git & GitHub

##  Pages
- Home (Navbar, Hero, Features, Footer)
- About (Services Section)
- Contact (Responsive Form UI)

##  Deployment
Hosted using GitHub Pages.

##  Learning Reflection
I explored Bootstrap documentation and examples to understand component structure. Instead of copying full templates, I combined selected components creatively. I used utility classes for spacing, alignment, and responsiveness.

### Challenges Faced
- Ensuring navbar responsiveness
- Maintaining consistent spacing
- Making layout visually balanced

### Time Taken
Approx. 7–8 hours
